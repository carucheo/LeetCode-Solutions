# LeetCode Practice Solutions

This repository contains my curated solutions to a variety of algorithm and data structure problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), implemented in both **C++** and **Python**. The goal of this project is to strengthen my problem-solving skills and build a strong foundation for technical interviews.

## 📚 What’s Inside

- Solutions to problems across categories such as arrays, strings, hashing, two pointers, and more
- Inline comments and structured explanation blocks for readability and understanding
- Code written with clarity and maintainability in mind
- Both brute-force and optimized solutions where applicable

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- C++ (with standard libraries)
- Python (3.x, standard libraries only)

## ✍️ Coding Style & Documentation

Each solution includes:
- A descriptive comment block at the top explaining the problem, approach, and time/space complexity
- Inline comments to guide through the logic step-by-step
- Clean and consistent formatting for readability

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository is part of my ongoing learning and interview preparation journey. It serves as:
- A personal reference for common algorithmic patterns
- A way to track my growth and revisit older solutions for refinement
- A demonstration of my ability to write clear, efficient, and well-documented code

## 🤝 Contributions

This repository is a solo effort for learning and growth. Suggestions or discussions are always welcome via issues or pull requests.
